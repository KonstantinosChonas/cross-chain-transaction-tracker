# GitHub Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Docker Compose Service Dependencies**

**Problem**: Services in `docker-compose.yml` depended on `redis`, `postgres`, `anvil`, and `solana` which were only defined in `test-docker-compose.yml`, causing errors like:

- `service "api" depends on undefined service "redis": invalid compose project`
- `service "rust" depends on undefined service "redis": invalid compose project`
- `service "api" depends on undefined service "postgres": invalid compose project`

**Solution**:

- Merged all infrastructure services into `docker-compose.yml` with proper health checks
- Both compose files now have all necessary services defined
- Added health checks to all services for proper dependency management
- Updated service dependencies to use `condition: service_healthy`

### 2. **Service Startup Timeouts (Exit Code 124)**

**Problem**: Workflows were timing out waiting for Ethereum and Solana nodes to be ready:

```
timeout 60 bash -c 'until curl -sf http://localhost:8545 > /dev/null; do sleep 2; done'
Error: Process completed with exit code 124.
```

**Solution**:

- Replaced manual timeout loops with `docker compose up -d --wait` which waits for health checks
- Added proper health check tests with JSON-RPC calls instead of simple HTTP requests
- Separated infrastructure startup from application startup for better control
- Added verification steps after services start

### 3. **Health Check Improvements**

**Problem**: Health checks were using simple HTTP requests that didn't verify actual service functionality.

**Solution**: Updated health checks to use proper RPC calls:

- **Ethereum (Anvil)**: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}`
- **Solana**: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth"}`
- **Application services**: Direct health endpoint checks with proper error handling

### 4. **Full E2E Test Suite Condition**

**Problem**: `test-e2e-full` job was skipped on `workflow_dispatch` events.

**Solution**: Updated the condition to run on:

- Pushes to `main` or `release/*` branches (existing behavior)
- Manual workflow dispatch with `suite=all` or `suite=e2e` (new behavior)

### 5. **Error Handling in Cleanup Steps**

**Problem**: Cleanup steps failed when compose validation failed, preventing proper cleanup.

**Solution**: Added `|| true` to all cleanup commands to ensure they don't fail the workflow:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml down -v || true
docker compose -f infra/test-docker-compose.yml down -v || true
```

## Files Modified

### Docker Compose Files

1. **`infra/docker-compose.yml`**

   - Added all infrastructure services (postgres, redis, anvil, solana)
   - Added health checks to all services
   - Updated service dependencies with health check conditions
   - Added proper environment variables and ports

2. **`infra/test-docker-compose.yml`**
   - Added health checks to all services
   - Updated Anvil command to include `--host 0.0.0.0`
   - Updated Solana command to explicitly set RPC port

### Workflow Files

3. **`.github/workflows/integration-e2e.yml`**

   - Updated service startup to use `--wait` flag
   - Replaced timeout loops with health check verification
   - Added proper service verification steps
   - Updated Full E2E test condition
   - Added error handling to cleanup steps

4. **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`**

   - Updated build and cleanup steps to handle separate compose files
   - Added error handling

5. **`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`**
   - Updated all test jobs (load, stress, chaos) with new startup pattern
   - Replaced timeout loops with `--wait` and verification steps
   - Added error handling to cleanup steps

### Scripts

6. **`scripts/test-start.sh`**

   - Updated to start test infrastructure first with `--wait`
   - Build and start application services separately with `--wait`
   - Removed combined compose file invocation

7. **`scripts/test-stop.sh`**

   - Updated to stop compose files separately
   - Added error handling with `|| true`

8. **`scripts/e2e.sh`**
   - Updated to rely on `--wait` in test-start.sh
   - Improved service verification with better error messages
   - Updated health check logic for both Rust and Go services

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run Integration Tests**: Verify the integration test job completes successfully
2. **Run E2E Tests**: Test all three E2E test matrix jobs (ethereum, solana, chaos)
3. **Test Manual Dispatch**: Use workflow_dispatch to ensure input handling works
4. **Verify Health Checks**: Ensure services start up reliably with health checks
5. **Test Cleanup**: Confirm cleanup happens even when tests fail

## Expected Behavior

- Services now start reliably with health checks
- No more timeout errors (exit code 124)
- No more "undefined service" errors
- Proper cleanup even when errors occur
- Full E2E suite runs when manually triggered with appropriate inputs
- Faster startup due to parallel service initialization with health checks
