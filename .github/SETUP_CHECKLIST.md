Use this checklist to complete the CI/CD implementation.

## âœ… Phase 1: Verify Files (Complete)

- [x] `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` - PR validation workflow
- [x] `.github/workflows/integration-e2e.yml` - Integration and E2E tests
- [x] `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - Code coverage reporting
- [x] `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` - Scheduled comprehensive tests
- [x] `.github/CI_BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Detailed documentation
- [x] `.github/README.md` - Quick reference guide
- [x] `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership definitions
- [x] `.github/setup-branch-protection.sh` - Setup script (Linux/macOS)
- [x] `.github/setup-branch-protection.ps1` - Setup script (Windows)
- [x] `README.md` - Updated with CI badges

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: GitHub Configuration (Action Required)

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions

- [ ] Go to repository Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
- [ ] Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
- [ ] Save if changed

### 2. Configure Branch Protection

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**

```bash
# Linux/macOS
cd .github
chmod +x setup-branch-protection.sh
./setup-branch-protection.sh

# Windows PowerShell
cd .github
.\setup-branch-protection.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual via GitHub Web UI**

- [ ] Go to Settings â†’ Branches
- [ ] Click "Add branch protection rule"
- [ ] For `main` branch, configure:
  - [x] Pattern: `main`
  - [x] Require pull request before merging (1 approval)
  - [x] Require status checks to pass
  - [x] Require branches to be up to date
  - [x] Status checks to require:
    - `test-unit-rust`
    - `test-unit-go`
    - `test-go-race`
    - `lint`
    - `build`
    - `test-integration`
    - `test-e2e` (all matrix jobs)
    - `coverage-rust`
    - `coverage-go`
  - [x] Require conversation resolution
  - [x] Require linear history
  - [x] Do not allow force pushes
  - [x] Do not allow deletions
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Repeat for `develop` branch with lighter checks (see docs)

### 3. Verify Initial Workflow Runs

- [ ] Push a small change to trigger workflows
- [ ] Go to Actions tab
- [ ] Verify all workflows appear
- [ ] Check that at least one workflow run completes successfully

## ðŸ”§ Phase 3: Optional Enhancements

### Code Coverage Integration

- [ ] Sign up at [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository
- [ ] Get your Codecov token
- [ ] Add to GitHub: Settings â†’ Secrets â†’ Actions
  - Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
  - Value: `<your-token>`
- [ ] Trigger coverage workflow to test

### Notification Setup (Optional)

- [ ] **Slack Integration:**
  - Create incoming webhook in Slack
  - Add to GitHub Secrets: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- [ ] **Microsoft Teams Integration:**
  - Create incoming webhook in Teams
  - Add to GitHub Secrets: `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`

### Code Owners (Recommended)

- [ ] Edit `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- [ ] Replace `@KonstantinosChonas` with actual GitHub usernames
- [ ] Add team members for each component
- [ ] In branch protection, enable "Require review from Code Owners"

## ðŸ§ª Phase 4: Testing the CI Pipeline

### Test PR Workflow

- [ ] Create a new branch: `git checkout -b test/ci-pipeline`
- [ ] Make a small change (e.g., add a comment)
- [ ] Push and create PR
- [ ] Verify all PR checks run and pass
- [ ] Check that merge is blocked until checks pass
- [ ] Verify coverage report appears as PR comment

### Test Main Branch Workflow

- [ ] Merge the test PR
- [ ] Verify full E2E suite runs on main
- [ ] Check artifacts are uploaded
- [ ] Verify coverage reports are generated

### Test Nightly Workflow (Optional)

- [ ] Go to Actions â†’ Nightly and Scheduled Tests
- [ ] Click "Run workflow"
- [ ] Select options:
  - [x] Run fuzzing tests
  - [ ] Run load tests (optional)
- [ ] Start workflow
- [ ] Monitor execution

## ðŸ“Š Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

### Add Status Badges to README

Already added! Badges should automatically update:

- [ ] Verify badges appear in README.md
- [ ] Click each badge to ensure it links correctly
- [ ] All should show "passing" status

### Regular Checks

Set up recurring tasks:

**Weekly:**

- [ ] Review failed nightly test runs
- [ ] Check security scan results in Security tab
- [ ] Monitor coverage trends

**Monthly:**

- [ ] Update GitHub Actions to latest versions
- [ ] Review workflow performance and optimize
- [ ] Clean up old workflow runs and artifacts

**Quarterly:**

- [ ] Update Rust/Go toolchain versions in workflows
- [ ] Review and update branch protection rules
- [ ] Audit secrets and rotate if needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

You'll know the CI/CD is working correctly when:

- [ ] âœ… PR cannot be merged without passing all checks
- [ ] âœ… Status checks appear on every PR
- [ ] âœ… Coverage reports are generated and uploaded
- [ ] âœ… Nightly tests run automatically at 2 AM UTC
- [ ] âœ… Security scans appear in the Security tab
- [ ] âœ… Failed workflows upload artifacts for debugging
- [ ] âœ… All status badges show "passing"

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Workflows don't run

1. Check Actions are enabled (Settings â†’ Actions)
2. Verify workflow YAML syntax (no syntax errors shown)
3. Ensure trigger conditions are met (correct branch, event)

### Status checks don't appear in PR

1. Workflow must run at least once successfully
2. Check workflow job names match branch protection config
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to register checks

### Coverage upload fails

1. Verify `CODECOV_TOKEN` is set correctly
2. Check workflow logs for error messages
3. Ensure coverage files are being generated

### Tests timeout

1. Increase timeout in workflow YAML
2. Check Docker resources on runner
3. Verify test infrastructure starts correctly

## âœ¨ You're All Set!

Once you've completed this checklist, your CI/CD pipeline will:

- âœ… Run comprehensive tests on every PR
- âœ… Block merges if tests fail
- âœ… Track code coverage
- âœ… Run nightly security scans
- âœ… Perform load and chaos testing
- âœ… Provide detailed artifacts for debugging
